  * On the home page there is a carousel where users can scroll through some picutres.

* About Us - allows users to find out who we are and what we do by having them read a short paragraph.

* Facilities - allows users to find out what specific services we can provide and the facilities we have, by reading a list.

* Reviews - allows users to find out how other customers have enjoyed our services, by providing reviews from previous and current customers.

* Prices - allows users to find out what specific lessons are offered and at what cost, by providing the information in a table format.

* Contact/Booking Form - allows users to contact the school if they wish to book a service or ask for extra information. 

* Footer with links to social media accounts - allows the users to keep up to date with the school by following on social media.

### Structure

All pages of the webiste will have a consistent navigaton bar - which collapses when viewed on a small screen.

All pages of the webiste will have a footer with links to the social media accounts that users can view and follow to keep up to date with the company.

The website will use bootstrap grids to make the layout responsive to different devices and screen sizes.

The home page will contain an about us section explaining the goals of the riding school.

The home page will contain a facilities section explaining what the riding school has to offer and what makes it special from competitors.

The home page will contain a reviews section showing how other customers have enjoyed their time at the riding school.

The website will comtain a prices section which shows the lessons offered and their prices, including any special offers.

The website will comtain a contact section which alows users to get in touch with the school to request more information or book a lesson.

### Skeleton

I used Balsamiq to make the wireframes for this project. The website was designed to have 3 pages - home, prices and contact.
The wireframes were created for all pages for phone, tablet and desktop devices.

#### Wireframes Home

![Contact Page Desktop Wireframes](assets/wireframes/contact-desktop.PNG)  

The full wireframes can be found [here](assets/wireframes/Keep_Riding_Wireframes.bmpr).

#### Wireframes Comments

Please not there are a few changes to the site since the wireframes were made:

* Margins and padding were not included in the wireframes.

* Home page: A carousel of images is displayed instead of a single image.
This was added as it fufils the user need to view several pictures of horses, and removed the need for a separate gallery page.

* Home page: The desktop wireframe has all 3 sections side by side. 
Once the margins and specific text was added this view did not look ideal, 
so it was kept the same as the tablet layout.

* Prices page: I added a special offers section similar to that of lessons/hacks.
This was added as it increases the chance of returning/frequent users booking a block of lessons instead of just one at a time.
It also helps the user save some money and for the business it
increases the chances of returning/frequent users continuing to use this school in the future.
This is also a feature that most riding schools offer as the sport/hobby is costly for regular riders.

* For the contact page a background image and some information on opening times was added.
This was because once the form was added the page looked a bit bare when viewed on a desktop.
It also provides the user with information on when the school is open, helping them decide if this school aligns well with their own schedule.

* For the contact page a background image to the form was added. 
This was added as the user wants to see picures of horses throughout the site where possible.


### Surface

#### Colours

The two main colours used in the website are yellow (palegoldenrod) and brown (saddlebrown).
I picked these colours because I wanted the colour theme to match that of horse riding (brown/beige).

However, I did not want the website to feel dull or bland so I made some elements turn blue (#0c0cff) when the user hovers over them.  
I also picked picutres with some brighter colours in them, where possible, to help make the website more pleasing to the eye.

I used darkslategrey and whitesmoke colours for most of the text colour and saddlebrown for headings.

#### Typography

The two fonts used are from google fonts these are Roboto Slab for the headings and Montserrat for the body. 

#### Imagery

I found some images from the internet and further information can be found in the credits section.

### Meets User Needs

### Fixed Bugs

#### Navigation Bar Colours

In the navigation bar the active page text was not showing as the correct colour (saddlebrown).
![Navbar problem](assets/images/navbar-problem.PNG)
I discovered the problem using chrome developer tools to find the css selector of the problem text.  
![Navbar fix](assets/images/navbar-fix.PNG)

#### Collapsible Hamburger Menu

When the hamburger menu was opened on a small screen I wanted the naviagtional items to have smaller text and less padding.
I also did not want the underline to be shown on the active page in this circumstance.

From looking in chrome developer tools I noticed the change in the classes of the div element (highlighted below) 
from "collapse" to "collapsing" to "collapse show".
![Hamburger problem](assets/images/hamburger-menu.PNG)

Therefore I thought I could target the below css selectors. 

> .navbar-light .show .navbar-nav .nav-link, .navbar-light .collapsing .navbar-nav .nav-link  

However the div has "collapse show" classes when viewed on a larger device and not just when the navbar becomes a hamburger menu.
I targeted the above elements within a media query to solve this.

#### Carousel Images

For the carousel the images I picked had different aspect ratios, 
and this caused the overall height of the element to change every few seconds which was not pleasant to view 
as the below elements also changed position due to the carousel.  

I resolved this by making sure all the images had the same aspect ratio using cropping.

#### Form Fieldset

I made the fieldset height to be 100% so that they looked better on larger screens when these are set side by side.  

However this made the height of the parent element (div with class “col-12 col-lg-6” in my case) smaller 
than that of fieldset height, which was unexpected.  This also caused issues with the submit and reset button 
positioning and making them inside the fieldset in some situations.

I tried experiementing with different height values for fieldset and its parent div which did not solve the 
problem and then I googled and found this [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9116689/fieldset-does-not-follow-its-parents-height
) and from the post some [runnable example that explains my problem clearly ](http://jsfiddle.net/3hfytpw4/).  


Running the example demontrates the problem clearly (images below) you can see that the parent 
does not have the height which aligns with that of the fieldsets.

![Fieldset problem result](assets/images/fieldset-problem.PNG)
![Fieldset problem html](assets/images/fieldset-html.PNG)
![Fieldset problem css](assets/images/fieldset-css.PNG)

After some trial and error I found that commenting out the padding and margins in the css resulted in the below
desired result:
![Fieldset problem css](assets/images/fieldset-fix.PNG)

I removed the top/bottom padding and margins of fieldset and added these instead to the parent/child elements 
of fieldset. Note: The left/right padding and margins did not seem to cause any problems. Perhaps there is a more elegant solution to what I used but this worked fine for my needs, although a bit cumbersome.

#### Minor Fixes

* For the carousel I added a 4th indicator by adding an extra list iten to the carousel-indicators ordered list.

* In the prices section I had the images with a width of 100% as inline text, I discovered this error through the  [validator w3c](https://validator.w3.org/).
I removed this from the html and instead targeted these elements in the css file.

* For the text on the contact-img this was hard to pick a suitable colour for the text as the picutre
has many colours.  
I added an black transparent overlay so that the white text could be seen easier.

* For the contact form I added a black transparent overlay similar to above so the white test was easier to read 
where the image had a lighter green colour.  
However this made the heading, submit and reset buttons look faded out due to the overlay.  
I added the position relative to these elements to solve the issue.

* In the form I wanted the fieldset dotted line to go around the whole element.  
Due to bootstrap the fieldset legend width was set to 100%, discovered from chrome developer tools,
I added a width of auto to the element to solve the problem.

* In the form I made the textarea cols responsive by adding a width of 100% to the element.

* In the form I had set my labels for contact form to have a width of 40%, 
however my label "What is your experience/ability?" was greater than 40% width on some screen sizes causing a truncation issue.  
I changed the property to have a min-width of 40% instead which fixed the problem.

## Deployment

## Credits

### Code

* The bootstrap library was used to help make this website responsive for different devices. 

* Bootstrap also allowed me to create an dropdown navigation bar for smaller devices and the carousel on the home page.  
I could not have added these features without bootstrap as I currently do not have knowledge of Javascript.

### Content

* I gained inspiration for the layout of the website by looking at other horse riding websites 
including [Hall Place Equestrian Centre](https://hall-place.com/) and [Palmers Riding Stables](http://palmers-stables.com/). 

* The above websites were also helped me with what content to put in the 
about us and facilites sections on my home page.

* I had a look at the google reviews for the above riding schools to get an idea of what reviews to make for my fictional school.

### Media

* Carousel-img4 is an image I own.

* I found the following images online from [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/):
