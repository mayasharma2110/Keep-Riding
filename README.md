## Structure

All pages of the webiste will have a consistent navigaton bar - which collapses when viewed on a small screen.

All pages of the webiste will have a footer with links to the social media accounts that users can view and follow to keep up to date with the company.

The website will use bootstrap grids to make the layout responsive to different devices and screen sizes.

The home page will contain an about us section explaining the goals of the riding school.

The home page will contain a facilities section explaining what the riding school has to offer and what makes it special from competitors.

The home page will contain a reviews section showing how other customers have enjoyed their time at the riding school.

The website will comtain a prices section which shows the lessons offered and their prices, including any special offers.

The website will comtain a contact section which alows users to get in touch with the school to request more information or book a lesson.

## Skeleton

I used Balsamiq to make the wireframes for this project and they can be found [here](assets/Keep_Riding_Wireframes.bmpr).
The website was designed to have 3 pages - home, prices and contact.

All 3 pages are designed to have similar general shape in terms of margins and padding.
I also aimed for there to be some content hinting where possible to encourage the user to keep scrolling.

## Surface

### Colours

The two main colours used in the website are yellow (palegoldenrod) and brown (saddlebrown).
I picked these colours because I wanted the colour theme to match that of horse riding (brown/beige).

However, I did not want the website to feel dull or bland so I made some elements turn blue (royalblue) when the user hovers over them.
I also picked picutres with some brighter colours in them, where possible, to help make the website more pleasing to the eye.

I used DarkSlateGrey and whitesmoke colours for most of the text colour and saddlebrown for headings.

### Typography

The two fonts used are from google fonts these are Roboto Slab for the headings and Montserrat for the body. 

### Imagery

I found some images from the internet and further information can be found in the credits section.

## Meets user/owner needs

## Fixed bugs

### Major bugs

#### Bug 1

In the navigation bar the active page text was not showing as the correct colour (saddlebrown).
I had to add the following code to resolve the problem, I did this using chrome developer tools to inspect the font colour of the problem text.

.navbar-light .navbar-nav .active>.nav-link {
    color: saddlebrown;
    font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;
    font-size: 1.8rem;
}

#### Bug 2

When the hamburger menu was opened on a small screen I wanted the naviagtional items to have smaller text and less padding.
I also did not want the underline to be shown ont he active page in this circumstance.

From looking in chrome developer tools I thought I could target 
".navbar-light .show .navbar-nav .nav-link, .navbar-light .collapsing .navbar-nav .nav-link"
as I noticed the change in the classes of the div element from collapse to collapsing to collapse show.
However the div has "collapse show" classes when viewed on a larger device and not just when the navbar becomes a hamburger menu.
I targeted the above elements within a media query to solve this.

#### Bug 3

For the carousel the images I picked had different aspect ratios, 
and this caused the overall height of the element to change every few seconds which was not pleasant to view 
as the below elements also changed position due to the carousel. 
I resolved this by making sure all the images had the same aspect ratio using cropping.

#### Bug 4

I made the fieldset height to be 100% so that they looked better on larger screens when these are set side by side.
However this made the height of the parent element (div with class “col-12 col-lg-6” in my case) smaller than that of fieldset height, which was very unexpected.
This also caused issues with ther submit and reset button positioning and making them very inside the fieldset in some situations.

I tried experiementing with different height values for fieldset and its parent div which did not solve the 
problem and then I googled and found this [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9116689/fieldset-does-not-follow-its-parents-height
) and from the post some [runnable example that explains my problem clearly ](http://jsfiddle.net/3hfytpw4/).
As you can see if you click the second link and then run the example the parent with class “divContainer blahContainer” 
does not have the height which aligns with that of the fieldsets.

I had to remove padding and margins (top/bottom) of fieldset and add these instead to the parent/child elements 
of fieldset. 
Perhaps there is a more elegant solution to what I used but this worked fine for my needs, although a bit cumbersome.

### Minor bugs/fixes

* For the carousel I added a 4th indicator by adding an extra list iten to the carousel-indicators ordered list
* For the text on the contact-img this was hard to pick a suitable colour for the text as the picutre has many colours.
I added an black transparent overlay so that the white text could be seen easier.
* For the contact form I added a black transparent overlay similar to above so the white test was easier to read 
where the image had a lighter green colour, however this made the header, submit and reset buttons look faded out due to the overlay.
I added the position relative to these elements to solve the issue.
* In the form I wanted the fieldset dotted line to go around the whole element.
Due to bootstrap the fieldset legend width was set to 100%, discovered in chrome developer tools, I added width: auto; to the element to solve the problem.
* In the form I made the textarea cols responsive by adding width: 100%; to the element.
* In the form I had set my labels for contact form to have a width of 40%, 
however my label "What is your experience/ability?" was greater than 40% width on some screen sizes causing a truncation issue.
I changed the property to have a min-width of 40% instead which fixed the problem.
