# Keep Riding

[Link to live project.](https://mayasharma2110.github.io/Keep-Riding/)

This is a website for a horse riding school. It is aimed for those who are interested in taking up horse riding or those with previous experience who wish to improve thier skills.
The riding school is for those of any age, gender or ability. The business goals are to increase interaction with potential new customers and increase the number of lessons/hacks booked.

It is different from competitors as it offers lessons in dressage and show jumping from a small group of experienced instructors. They give private lessons or small groups lessons and have an indoor and outdoor arena.
They also offer hacks where you can explore the surrounding area and have a small cafe where you can buy refreshments.
