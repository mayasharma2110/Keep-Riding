* About Us - allows users to find out who we are and what we do by having them read a short paragraph.
* Facilities - allows users to find out what specific services we can provide and the facilities we have, by reading a list.
* Reviews - allows users to find out how other customers have enjoyed our services, by providing reviews from previous and current customers.
* Prices - allows users to find out what specific lessons are offered and at what cost, by providing the information in a table format.
* Contact/Booking Form - allows users to contact the school if they wish to book a service or ask for extra information. 
* Footer with links to social media accounts - allows the users to keep up to date with the school by following on social media.

## Structure

All pages of the webiste will have a consistent navigaton bar - which collapses when viewed on a small screen.

The home page will contain an about us section explaining the goals of the riding school.

The website will use bootstrap grids to make the layout responsive to different devices and screen sizes.

All pages of the webiste will have a footer with links to the social media accounts that users can view and follow to keep up to date with the company.

The home page will contain a facilities section explaining what the riding school has to offer and what makes it special from competitors.

The website will comtain a prices section which shows the lessons offered and their prices, including any special offers.

The home page will contain a reviews section showing how other customers have enjoyed their time at the riding school.

The website will comtain a contact section which alows users to get in touch with the school to request more information or book a lesson.

## Skeleton

I used Balsamiq to make the wireframes for this project and they can be found [here](assets/Keep_Riding_Wireframes.bmpr).
The website was designed to have 3 pages - home, prices and contact.

## Surface

### Colours

The three main colours used in the website are yellow (palegoldenrod), brown (saddlebrown) and blue (royalblue).
I picked these colours because I wanted the colour theme to match that of horse riding (brown/beige) however I also wanted some colour to stand out which is why some elements turn blue when the user hovers over them.
I also used DarkSlateGrey and whitesmoke colours for some of the text colour.

### Typography

The two fonts used are from google fonts these are Roboto Slab for the headings and Montserrat for the body. 

### Imagery

I found some images from the internet and further information can be found in the credits section.

## Fixed bugs

### Bug 1

Navigation bar - Active page text was not showing as the correct colour (saddlebrown).

![Bug1-problem](assets/images/bug1_1.png)

I had to add the following code to resolve the problem, I did this using chrome developer tools to inspect the font colour of the problem text.

![Bug1-resolution](assets/images/bug1_2.png)

### Bug 2

I wanted some vertical whitespace between the sections in the home page, due to using bootstrap grid layout using margins did not work as desired.

![Bug2-problem](assets/images/bug2_1.png)

I added a div inside the columns and gave it a width of 100% of the parent element.

![Bug2-resolution](assets/images/bug2_2.png)

### Bug 3

I wanted the legend for the fieldset to go around the whole box other than the text.

![Bug3-problem](assets/images/bug3_1.png)

Due to bootstrap the legend width was set to 100%, I added width: auto; to the element to solve the problem.

![Bug3-resolution](assets/images/bug3_2.png)

### Bug 4

I had set my labels for contact form to be 40%, however my label "What is your experience/ability?" was greater than 40% width on some screen sizes causing a truncation issue.

![Bug4-problem](assets/images/bug4_1.png)

I changed the property to have a min-width of 40% instead which fixed the problem.
